# k-mer-tool
The tool breaks a sequence into smaller overlapping or non-overlapping subsequences of length K, counts the occurrences of each unique K-mer, and uses that information for various analyses (such as identifying conserved sequences).
â€¢My K-mer Analysis Tool is designed to be fast, user-friendly, and computationally efficient.
*It automates the process of K-mer extraction, counting, and visualization with optimized algorithms.
*Built to run on both small and large-scale genomic data, the tool improves accessibility and reduces computational bottlenecks.
